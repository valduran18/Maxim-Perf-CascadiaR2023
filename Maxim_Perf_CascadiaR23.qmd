## What is Optimization?

::: {.fragment fragment-index="1"}
> An act, process, or methodology of making something (such as a design, system, or decision) as fully perfect, functional, or effective as possible. -- Merriam-Webster
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="2"}
Code optimization is the process of enhancing code quality and efficiency.

## Pre-Optimization Steps {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Make the code work.
-   Don't repeat yourself.
-   Write clean code and document it well.
-   Don't try to reinvent the wheel.

Optimization should be the **final** step of your programming practice. Performance can be high following the pre-optimization steps. Only optimize when it's necessary!

## Steps to Optimize Code {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  Make sure code runs as expected, is clean, is well documented, and is created with the **end user** in mind.
2.  Profile code (identify where the slow code is)
3.  Find other solutions
    1.  [Vectorize code when possible]{.fragment .highlight-red}
    2.  [Use parallelization techniques]{.fragment .highlight-red}
    3.  [Cache frequently used data]{.fragment .highlight-red}
    4.  [Manage memory]{.fragment .highlight-red}
    5.  [Find a faster function/package]{.fragment .highlight-red} 
4.  Benchmark code (compare code with your solution)  
5.  Execute!
